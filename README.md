Hey 👋, I'm Anas!

I’m currently a student in LM6E (also known as Lydex). I started making games in Unity as a hobby, and it’s what makes me thrive every day, as I get the chance to cooperate with classmates and learn more. I really think the science we learn at school comes in handy, as I use tons of concepts to simulate real-life physics, which is mind-blowing to me. I am thrilled to announce my debut in this journey and look forward to sharing my projects here in the upcoming months.

🔭 I’m currently working on a shooter game.
🌱 I’m currently learning competitive programming.
