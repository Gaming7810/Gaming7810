Hey ðŸ‘‹, I'm Anas!

Iâ€™m currently a student in LM6E (also known as Lydex). I started making games in Unity as a hobby, and itâ€™s what makes me thrive every day, as I get the chance to cooperate with classmates and learn more. I really think the science we learn at school comes in handy, as I use tons of concepts to simulate real-life physics, which is mind-blowing to me. I am thrilled to announce my debut in this journey and look forward to sharing my projects here in the upcoming months.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a shooter game.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning competitive programming.
